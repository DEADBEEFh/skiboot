<h2>General comments<a class="headerlink" href="#general-comments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>skiboot does not require nodes to have phandle properties, but
if you have them then <em>all</em> nodes must have them including the
root of the device-tree (currently a HB bug !). It is recommended
to have them since they are needed to represent the cache levels.</li>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: The example tree below only has phandle properties for
nodes that are referenced by other nodes. This is <em>not</em> correct
and is purely done for keeping this document smaller, make sure
to follow the rule above.</li>
<li>Only the &#8220;phandle&#8221; property is required. Sapphire also generates
a &#8220;linux,phandle&#8221; for backward compatibility but doesn&#8217;t require
it as an input</li>
<li>Any property not specifically documented must be put in &#8220;as is&#8221;</li>
<li>All ibm,chip-id properties contain a HW chip ID which correspond
on P8 to the PIR value shifted right by 7 bits, ie. it&#8217;s a 6-bit
value made of a 3-bit node number and a 3-bit chip number.</li>
<li>Unit addresses (&#64;xxxx part of node names) should if possible use
lower case hexadecimal to be consistent with what skiboot does
and to help some stupid parsers out there...</li>
